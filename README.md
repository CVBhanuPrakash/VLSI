# Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) Circuit Design

The project addresses one of the fundamental challenges in electronic devices—heat dissipation—by exploring the potential of reversible Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) circuits. In this project, we focus on the design and optimization of key QCA gates and circuits to achieve more efficient and heat-resistant electronic devices.

## Key Contributions:

- **CNOT Gate Enhancement:** The project introduces the latest versions of the CNOT gate, aiming to improve its performance and efficiency within QCA circuits.

- **Double CNOT Gate:** An enhanced version of the CNOT gate is presented, further optimizing its functionality and heat dissipation properties.

- **TOFFOLI Gate Design:** The universal TOFFOLI gate is explored and improved upon to make it more suitable for QCA-based computing.

- **Single TOFFOLI with NOT Gates:** A novel approach involves the integration of a single TOFFOLI gate with 5 NOT gates, expanding the capabilities of QCA circuits.

- **SWAP Circuit:** The project also includes the design of a SWAP circuit, an essential component for data manipulation in QCA-based systems.

## Course Project:

This project was undertaken as part of a VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) course, reflecting my dedication to advancing electronic design and addressing critical issues like heat dissipation in electronic devices.
